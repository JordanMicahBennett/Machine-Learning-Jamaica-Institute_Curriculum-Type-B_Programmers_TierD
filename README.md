# [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) Curriculum Type B, Tier D (For programmers that don't know python, and don't know github)
## Course Code: "MLJI-CTBTD"

# Main Overview
This curriculum consists of 3 main parts and one final optional part: 
1. The first semester, concerning **a quick review of python structure, since you're already a programmer** and a tutorial on **regularly used machine learning libraries in python**.
2. The second semester, concerning using **github**. (Github will contain your work, and employers prefer to see healthy github pages!)
3. The third semester, concerning the main topic, **[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)**!
4. The last and fourth semester, concerning applying knowledge from the prior semesters, and attempting to **solve a problem faced by preferably the Jamaican country or elsewhere**. (The code/idea developed is yours, and is not the property of [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/).)

# Third Semester (Estimated Completion Duration: 6 weeks and 4 hours) ~ Study and Write "[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)" Code:


## Week 1 - Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks

1. Follow closely, [this 9 step neural network construction tutorial by Eden Au](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-in-python-numpy-neural-network-in-9-steps-eafd0db25906).
2. **Intuitive understanding** of basic machine learning components, such as fundamental artificial neural network structures, is important for **maintaining the desire** to continue to pursue the field of artificial intelligence/machine learning/data science. If you still desire a more intuitive description of the basic artificial neural networks described in item 1 above, read the text descriptions and watch the video content found in my book "**Artificial Neural Networks for Kids**". (Get the book from [this Amazon url](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FX57ZZ), or get it free from [this Research-Gate url](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321162382_Artificial_Neural_Nets_For_Kids)).
3. Try to construct a basic artificial neural network from scratch, without the usage of any machine learning library. (You can follow this guidline of mine [here](https://its2019.iis-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ITS-2019-Tutorial.pdf) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PqCvorCsCiPqVkYZPjDpiIk41NOfGz-c/view?usp=sharing), taken from my presentation/programming tutorial at [ITS 2019](https://its2019.iis-international.org/program/selected-workshops-and-tutorials/).)
4. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-MLJI-Week-1", or something similar.

## Week 2 - Machine Learning Library Practice
1. Try to grind through [this 3 hour course on Tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKHh7_zzJc&t=126s). Tensorflow is a popular machine learning library. You can start with this, or resort to other libraries like MXNET. 

* You can use any one of these libraries for the subsequent weeks. Note that Tensorflow has the support of Google, so it may be wise to choose this library. MXNET also has the support of Microsoft, so that is not a bad option either.

## Week 3 - Convolutional Artificial Neural Networks

1. Watch [Convolution Neural Networks - explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pOnJxOcqY) by Code Emporium.
2. Write a Convolutional Neural Network (using any ML library like Tensorflow), based on video above.
3. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-MLJI-Week-3", or something similar.

## Week 4 - Recurrent Artificial Neural Networks

1. Watch [Recurrent Neural Networks - explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZv_yRgOvMg) by Code Emporium.
2. Write a Recurrent Neural Neural Network (using any ML library like Tensorflow), based on video above.
3. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-MLJI-Week-4", or something similar.

## Week 5 - Generative Adversarial Neural Networks
1. Watch [Generative Adversarial Networks - FUTURISTIC & FUN AI!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8LAi6ksC80) by Code Emporium.
2. Watch ["Make a Face Generative Adversarial Network in 15 MINUTES!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbW-X6iW5jE) by Discover Artificial Intelligence.
3. Write a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (using any ML library like Tensorflow), based on video above.
4. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-MLJI-Week-5", or something similar.

## Week 6 - Deep Reinforcement Learning
1. Watch this [fun introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgvyzIkgxF0) by Arxiv Insights.

2. Remember [the self driving car that was launched by Google in Arizona](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/waymo-launches-nations-first-commercial-self-driving-taxi-service-in-arizona/2018/12/04/8a8cd58a-f7ba-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html)? 

* Simply try to run [this self driving car simulation here, based on Tensorflow](https://github.com/pekaalto/DQN) to get a reasonable idea of how Google Waymo was built.

3. Optionally, read [my 6 minute introduction to deep q learning](https://medium.com/@jordanmicahbennett/a-simple-8-minute-deepmind-deep-q-learning-schematic-in-input-process-outcome-cycle-laymen-terms-bb6916ccddb8). Deep Q learning is a variant of reinforcement learning.

4. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-MLJI-Week-6", or something similar.


## Third Semester/Credits

Note: Please try to complete [the Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Yoshua Bengio et al. (Bengio is one of the winners of the winners of the 2018 Turing Award, a Nobel-Prize like award for Artificial Intelligence. See the CBS News Report on [the aforesaid 2018 Turing Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWIV5xQoYbA)).

# Fourth Semester (Estimated Completion Duration: 2+ weeks) ~ Apply prior semesters' knowledge to build an app of your choosing.
1. Search for a **problem to solve** preferably in Jamaica or otherwise worldwide: 

      a. If the problem has **not yet been solved** worldwide or in Jamaica, you can **manipulate any existing python/tensorflow code** etc, to solve the problem.
      
      b. If the problem has **already been solved**, try to apply whatever you learnt to either achieve the same efficiency, or better, by using **your own code assemblies**.

2. Note that what ever the result, **this code is yours**, given that the code used is freely usable. The last semester is optional, but will:
      
      a. Be a good way to showcase your experience, beyond the scope of the guidelines from prior semesters. (aka **show creativity and added experience**)

      b. Be a huge plus on your github profile, that **employers may appreciate**!
      
3. For **this final semester** in particular, **you may or may not chose** to upload your code to github (while naming it as something like "My-Code_For-MLJI-FinalSemester"):

      a. If you plan to form a **company around that code/solution**, then you may opt to keep your final semester code on a **private platform** like Google drive instead of Github. After that, you may then add a reference to your portfolio page as an entry/item together with works/items from weeks 1 to 6. **(See portfolio section below)**. If you kept that final-semester code to yourself,  it would appeal to employers if you describe it briefly as an entry item on your portfolio, regarding how your new company/solution leverages machine learning to solve the unsolved or insufficiently solved problem you discovered.
      
      b. You could still choose to upload code to Github, prior to which you would have copyrighted it. In your portfolio, [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) will tell the public that it is copyrighted in this case. **(See portfolio section below.)**
      
      c. Otherwise, you could make your final semester code free to the public, and simply upload it to Github, naming it as suggested in the beggining of item 3.

# Your portfolio
We'll provide you with your own portfolio page (aka your portfolio URL), at [mlj-institute.appspot.com/students/< your-username >/< your-mlji-id >](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/https-github.com-JordanMicahBennett-Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_SampleCandidatePortfolio/blob/master/students/Jane-Doe/MLJI-JANE-GMAIL.COM/PORTFOLIO.MD). (See sample portfolio [here](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/https-github.com-JordanMicahBennett-Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_SampleCandidatePortfolio/blob/master/students/Jane-Doe/MLJI-JANE-GMAIL.COM/PORTFOLIO.MD).)

The portfolio will list all your uploaded works, including your final-semester code (if you chose to upload the final-semester-code). You'll provide descriptions and github links of each work entry uploaded to github on the portfolio.

This portfolio will be accessible from your URL above, and will appeal to your employers!
